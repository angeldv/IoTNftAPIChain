# IoTNftAPIChain

## Description

A Solidity-based NFT marketplace contract utilizing Merkle tree proofs for gas-efficient whitelisting and on-chain royalty enforcement, optimized for Layer 2 scaling solutions via custom data serialization.

## Features

- Integrate sensor data streams directly into NFT metadata using a decentralized oracle network.
- Implement a RESTful API for querying NFT ownership and associated IoT device states.
- Utilize Merkle trees to efficiently verify the integrity of historical sensor data linked to an NFT.
- Develop a secure key management system for IoT devices using hardware security modules (HSMs) and blockchain-based access control.
- Establish a decentralized identity (DID) system for IoT devices, allowing for verifiable credentials and secure communication within the network.
- Enable automated royalty distribution to IoT device manufacturers and data providers based on NFT usage.
- Design a fault-tolerant architecture that ensures continuous API availability even during network disruptions.
- Support cross-chain NFT transfers and IoT data access using atomic swaps and bridge technologies.
